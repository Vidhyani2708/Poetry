          <p class="poem">A place which once we all hated<br>But its where the best memories are created<br>About the school we had a lot complaints<br>The teacher made so many constraints<br>The exams and the lesson weren't so nice<br>But enjoy this days, its my advice<br>When the school days end<br>You'll realize, it was a prime time spend.</p>
