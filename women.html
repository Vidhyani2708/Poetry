          <h2>Women</h2>
          <p class="poem">A women everyday gets judged<br>For her clothes and appearance<br>Yet gears up enough courage to face it all<br>And they say women are weak<br>A women fights everyday with the world for her rights<br>She fights everyday for her stand<br>She fights everyday for being a woman<br>And they say women are weak<br>A woman, every single moment fights for her safety<br>
        A woman every single night when traveling alone hopes that she is protected from the evils of the society<br>Yet she hides all this behind a a smile<br>And they say women are weak<br>A women bears the pain of 20 bones breaking all together while giving birth to a child<br>And they say women are weak<br>A women bleeds average 8 years of her life<br>And they women are weak<br>After learning about a woman's bravery<br>Do they still have the right to call a women weak?</p>
